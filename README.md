# Simple AWS Web application tutorial
## Overview

In this tutorial, you will create a simple Web application. First, you will create a static web app that display "Hello World". Then, you will learn how to add functionality to the web application so that the displayed text is based on custom input you provide.

## What you will accomplish

- Create web application.
- Connect the web application to a serverless backend.
- Add interactivity to the web application using an API and a database.

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this tutorial, you will need:

- An AWS account: If you don't already have an account, follow the AWS' basics guide for a brief overview.

## Application Architecture

The following diagram provides a visual representation of the services used in this tutorial and how they are interconnected. The application uses AWS Amplify, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

As we progress through the tutorial, we will delve into these services in detail and point out which resources will help you learn more about them.
